			<h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
			<p>
			GitHub is mostly used for code sharing and publishing. 
			The site allows users to upload and create projects that can be viewed and added to by other people.
			Programmers also use GitHub as a social networking site. It is a great place for people to enhance their programming skills.
			You can create a personal or host other websites using GitHub pages.
			</p>
			<h2>Creating Your Own Website</h2>
			<p>
			To create your personal website using GitHub, you should follow the steps listed below.
				<ol>
					<li>First, you need to create a <strong>repository</strong>. It has to be <em>username.github.io</em> (use your username).</li>
					<li>Next, if you are using Windows, you need to publish and clone the repository.</li>
					<li>Open your favorite text editor (such as Notepad ++) and create an index.html file.</li>
					<li>Finally you have to enter the repository, commit your changes, and press the sync button.</li>
				</ol>
			Your website will sync in a few minutes and it will show up at http://username.github.io/.
			</p>
			<p>
			There are a few thing that you need to know to better understand how to use GitHub.
			<br>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Repositories</strong> are used to store your projects. There are public and private repositories. 
				Privates repositories are not free so it may be easier to just stick to public.</li>
				<br>
				<li>A <strong>commit</strong> is a snapshot of the files that are in your project at a certain time.</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>README's</strong> are used like comments. They can tell a user how to download something or just give an explaination.</li>
				<br>
				<li>A <strong>fork</strong> is a copy of a repository. Forking allows you to experiment with projects and make changes without affecting the original project.</li>
				<br>
				<li>You can also use GitHub for social reasons. You can follow other people, watch projects, and contribute to projects that allow for it.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			Once you have successfully created you index.html file, you can edit it as much as you want. To do this you first need to select and open the index file.<br>
			On the toolbar above, press the edit button (it looks like a pen). It will open up to you code in an editable form. When you're done, scroll down and save your changes.
